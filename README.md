As mentioned in my personal statement here is a screen shot of my Command Line interface Sneaker Bot.

You may not be familiar with a sneaker bot, if you are please read on. If not, I shall explain. Essentially a sneaker bot is an automated piece of software that increases your chances of purchasing a limited sneaker. Why would someone want to purchase a limited sneaker? Limited sneakers have low retail prices on the day they release but when the release has finished and there is no more stock left the re-sell price of the sneaker can double if not triple the value of the original retail price. Why would someone need software automation? They may need software automation as it will increase your chances of securing a limited sneaker. As the sneakers are so limited the chances of purchasing are extremely low thatâ€™s why automation increases the time and increases the chances of you acquiring the limited sneaker. Its exploitation of the scheme of supply and demand. Humans are no longer fast enough to acquire limited sneakers therefore software is now a big part of the sneaker community.

There are 4 more open source projects you may look at, some of which are mentioned in my personal statement. These projects present my strong programming skills which are needed for a computer science degree. Feel free to open any issues, download the code, or even alter it to make it better. Unfortunately, I cannot provide the code of my sneaker bot on a public platform as it will be monetized but I can happily email the file for further inspection.
